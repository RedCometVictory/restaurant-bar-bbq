intro: We spent the whole day on Labor Day changing and modifying the menu in our online ordering portals. I mean it took from about 10am through to 9pm with 1 break to walk the dog. We updated and added pictures and descriptions. We updated the items to make them quicker and easier to find for not only you trying to order online but also us at the register.

We spent the whole day on Labor Day changing and modifying the menu in our online ordering portals. I mean it took from about 10am through to 9pm with 1 break to walk the dog.

Another goal we had was making it easier on the kitchen. Not only how the kitchen receipt prints but also how many modifications get printed out on the receipt. It gets to be very difficult to sort through a long list of modifications as we are trying to build a burger and then sweating as the queue continues to get longer and longer. We hope that this one change will help us get through the waiting list faster, however, the customizations will be more limited. We do not want to get to the level of fast food, however, we do want to help get orders out faster. Here's an example.
<br />

The Lion Burger will now be very limited to how you can customize it. For example, if you would like a Lion Burger, count on it being with everything on it. However, you can make small modifications to it, like no onion, no mayo, etc but only up to 3 modifications. We apologize in advance for the inconvenience to you but we are trying to get to everyone a lot quicker. To compensate for this, you will notice a "Build-a-Burger" menu item. This one is a basic burger but you can customize the crap out of it. And if you do, it will cost extra as you will notice. For example, you can add up to 3 extra burger patties and 4 oz of brisket with extra cheese!
<br />

All that being said, we are also trying to control the amount of sauce that we keep buying. We see a lot of sauce just getting thrown away. So to help curtail the waste we are going to ask for a small fee to get some of the more popular sauces in little cups. It's 25 cents. Its not a lot but we are hoping that it might encourage some to be more realistic in their sauce needs. We understand that this can get annoying especially when you forget to ask for it so we will try to get it in front of you as we take your orders.
<br />

We are excited about the changes but also cautious. We are doing this because we are learning as we go. We never understood why restaurants would charge for things like ranch but as we experience it, we certainly understand. We hope that these changes will make it easier for all of us as we grow this restaurant.  Thank you so much for your patronage.

As a side note, we are going to create some videos to help you learn to use the order site and the mobile app. *So stay tuned!!*
