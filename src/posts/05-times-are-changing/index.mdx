intro: Quite literally they are changing. Well, our times are changing. What we mean is beginning next week, 1/18/20 we are going to start opening for dinner at 4 pm. We have noticed that quite a few orders try to come in before we open at 5, so we will make it public now, that you can make your order by 4 pm every day except for Thursday and Friday which we open at 11:30 on those days.

Quite literally they are changing. Well, our times are changing.  What we mean is beginning next week, 1/18/20 we are going to start opening for dinner at 4 pm. We have noticed that quite a few orders try to come in before we open at 5, so we will make it public now, that you can make your order by 4 pm every day except for Thursday and Friday which we open at 11:30 on those days. So to sum it all up:
<br />

Beginning 1/18/20 our hours will be as follows:
<br />

Monday: 4pm - 8pm
<br />

Tuesday: 4pm - 8pm
<br />

Wednesday: 4pm - 8pm
<br />

Thursday: 11:30am - 9pm
<br />

Friday: 11:30am - 9pm
<br />

Saturday: 4pm - 8pm
<br />

Sunday: 4pm - 8pm
<br />

However, after some time, it may go back to 5. Really depends on how it goes over the next few weeks. If only we can go back to normal...
