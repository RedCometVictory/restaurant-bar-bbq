intro: We turned on doordash recently. Its a limited menu and the costs are a little higher since we have to pay them commission (and its not cheap), but its available if you are looking for delivery when we cannot. Let us know how it goes. We tried to add the most common items and eliminated the the less common. Of course you can always order delivery from our own app when its available. So far, the drivers have been friendly, super helpful and very timely. As a side note, we have beef ribs in stock so let us know if you would like to get some.
